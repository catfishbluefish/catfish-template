		 		<p>catfish.bluefish is a small web design and development company created by Cat Fistori based out of the San Francisco Bay Area. After working full time as a web designer, product photographer and onsite SEO manager for a Shopify based e-commerce store <a href="www.beadshop.com">Beadshop.com</a>, Cat decided to start her own web development company. Too often she found people and companies juggling multiple contractors to complete their websites - someone to code it, someone to maintain it, someone to make design changes and decisions, marketing companies, product photographers, SEO researchers, graphic designers, and more.
		 		</p>
		 		<p>
		 		 But what if there was a company that could do all of that? Just one company to take you from an idea- to a design, complete with custom graphics and logos -  develop and publish it, maintain it, set up on-site SEO, set up social media platforms, and even take your product photos!
		 		</p><p>
		 		 Well, that is the goal here at catfish.bluefish, whether you need all of our services or just one - we are here to help you simplify your website experience.
